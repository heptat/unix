/**
 * A stack.
 *
 * Pop, push, peek, and maybe is_empty.
 *
 * Resize as necessary (define initial size of stack? yes if it's an
 * array, but no if you're dynamically allocating memory, which is probably
 * what you should do - so a singly linked list).
 *
 *
 * How to do unit testing (and therefore TDD) in C?
 *
 * Break struct and functions into lib files.
